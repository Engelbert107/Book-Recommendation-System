# Book Recommendation System

This project involves developing a book recommendation system that suggests relevant books to users based on a text query. Leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques, we explored data on book features and created a recommendation model, deploying the final system as an interactive web application using Streamlit. Users can search by entering a title, description, or keywords, and the system provides tailored book recommendations.

#### Deployment with Streamlit
- Users can input search queries and adjust the number of recommendations.
- The app outputs a list of relevant books with key details like title, authors, and publication date.
