# Book Recommendation System

We used the [Goodreads-books](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks) dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jealousleopard/goodreadsbooks) and developp a book recommendation system that suggests relevant books to users based on a text query. Leveraging natural language processing and machine learning, we analyzed key book features and created a recommendation model, which we deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit. Users can search by entering a title, description, or keywords, and the system will provide tailored book recommendations. Additionally, users can adjust the number of recommendations to fit their needs.

#### Deployment with Streamlit
- Users can input search queries and adjust the number of recommendations.
- The app outputs a list of relevant books with key details like title, authors, and publication date.
